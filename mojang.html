        Mojang Studios was founded by the independent video game designer Markus
        Persson in 2009 as Mojang Specifications for Minecraft's development.
        The studio inherited its name from another video game venture Persson
        had left two years prior. Following the game's initial release, Persson,
        in conjunction with Jakob Porsér, incorporated the business as Mojang AB
        in late 2010, and they hired Carl Manneh as the company's chief
        executive officer. Other early hires included Daniel Kaplan and Jens
        Bergensten. Minecraft became highly successful, giving Mojang sustained
        growth. With a desire to move on from the game, Persson offered to sell
        his share in Mojang, and the company was acquired by Microsoft in
        November 2014. Persson, Porsér, and Manneh subsequently left Mojang. In
        May 2020, Mojang was rebranded as Mojang Studios.
